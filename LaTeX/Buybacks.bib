abstract = {A multivariate time series model with time varying conditional variances and covariances, but constant conditional correlations is proposed. In a multivariate regression framework, the model is readily interpreted as an extension of the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model allowing for heteroskedasticity. Parameterizing each of the conditional variances as a univariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) process, the descriptive validity of the model is illustrated for a set of five nominal European U.S. dollar exchange rates following the inception of the European Monetary System (EMS). When compared to the pre-EMS free float period, the comovements between the currencies are found to be significantly higher over the later period.},

@article{Hennessy2010,
abstract = {As an alternative to the pecking order, we develop a dynamic calibratable model where the firm avoids mispricing via signaling. The model is rich, featuring endogenous investment, debt, default, dividends, equity flotations, and share repurchases. In equilibrium, firms with negative private information have negative leverage, issue equity, and overinvest. Firms signal positive information by substituting debt for equity. Default costs induce such firms to underinvest. Model simulations reveal that repeated signaling can account for countercyclical leverage, leverage persistence, volatile procylical investment, and correlation between size and leverage. The model generates other novel predictions. Investment rates are the key predictor of abnormal announcement returns in simulated data, with leverage only predicting returns unconditionally. Firms facing asymmetric information actually exhibit higher mean Q ratios and investment rates. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

However, excess returns depend on the likelihood of undervaluation and the efficiency and liquidity of equity markets. In contrast to findings in U.S. markets, we do not find that these long-term excess returns are simply a compensation for takeover risk or have become less significant in recent years.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years share repurchase programs have become an important payout method for US firms. Are these repurchases substitute for dividends? And if so, why has it taken so long to start to pay shareholders in a way that reduces their tax liability? Analyzing this trend we show that, unlike in the past, young firms have a strong tendency to pay cash through repurchases rather than dividends and that repurchases have become the preferred form of payout among firms initiating cash distributions to their equityholders.  Large-established firms also show a higher propensity to payout cash through repurchases. Although we do not find that these firms have been cutting dividends, it seems that they have been financing their repurchase programs with funds that otherwise would have been used to increase dividends.  These findings indicate that large-established firms have been gradually substituting repurchases for dividends.  We also find evidence that suggests that investors view dividends and share repurchases as substitute payout methods.  Specifically, we show that (1) the market reaction to dividend cuts is not significantly different from zero for repurchasing firms and (2) the market reaction surrounding share repurchase announcements is significantly more positive during periods where the benefit of substituting share repurchases for dividends is relatively large.  Finally we address the question of why corporations have been waiting for so long to substitute repurchases for dividends. We present evidence consistent with the notion that regulatory constraints inhibited firms from aggressively repurchasing shares until 1982. Our findings may provide a partial explanation for the dividend puzzle.  },

Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autore-gressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

We first consider the rule that the investor does (or should) maximize discounted expected, or anticipated, returns. This rule is re- jected both as a hypothesis to explain, and as a maximum to guide in- vestment behavior. We next consider the rule that the investor does (or should) consider expected return a desirable thing and variance of re- turn an undesirable thing.

Dividends are paid by firms with higher "permanent" operating cash flows, while repurchases are used by firms with higher "temporary", non-operating cash flows. Repurchasing firms also have much more volatile cash flows and distributions.

abstract = {Empirically, the announcement of an open-market stock repurchase program is accompanied by a price increase even though the announcement is not a commitment. In fact, for many announced programs no shares are ever actually repurchased. This paper explores this puzzle. Our model shows that the option that a firm grants itself by announcing a program cannot, by itself, generate announcement returns. In equilibrium, long-run gains from the adverse selection that this option creates are offset by short-run costs from the market's accounting for this adverse selection. Based on this trade-off, we construct a signaling model that does deliver announcement returns. In the separating equilibrium, good firms do not incur any cost when they announce a program. Their gains from adverse selection in the long run offset the cost of announcement incurred in the short run. Mimicry is costly because a bad firm's long-run gains from adverse selection cannot compensate for the short-run cost of announcing. The other main predictions of our model are that the post-announcement expected return will be relatively low in the short run but relatively high in the long run and that the post-announcement long-run return will be correlated with the level of actual repurchase. These predictions are broadly consistent with the empirical evidence.},

The fractional differencing operator is defined as an infinite binomial series expansion in powers of the backward-shift operator. Fractionally differenced processes exhibit long-term persistence and antipersistence; the dependence between observations a long time span apart decays much more slowly with time span than is the case with the more commonly studied time series models. Long-term persistent processes have applications in economics and hydrology; compared to existing models of long-term persistence, the family of models introduced here offers much greater flexibility in the simultaneous modelling of the short-term and long-term behaviour of a time series. {\textcopyright} 1981 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {We examine the impact of stock market liquidity on managerial payout decisions. We argue that stock market liquidity influences payout policy through a first-order effect on the share repurchase decision, and a second-order or residual effect on the dividend decision. Managers compare the tax and flexibility advantages of a repurchase against its liquidity cost disadvantage. All else equal, higher market liquidity encourages the use of repurchases over dividends. Our empirical results confirm that stock market liquidity plays a significant role in repurchase and dividend initiations, as well as in recurring payout decisions. Unlike previous studies that measure liquidity changes following the repurchase decision, we examine liquidity levels prior to the payout decision. We show that managers condition their repurchase decision on a sufficient level of market liquidity, consistent with Barclay and Smith's [Barclay, M.J., Smith, C.W. Jr., 1988. Corporate payout policy: cash dividends versus open-market repurchases.

This paper investigates three key economic motivations—mispricing, disgorging free cash flow, and increasing leverage—by evaluating cross-sectional differences in both the initial market reaction and long-run performance. The initial reaction provides some support for the mispricing story. However, subsequent earnings-related information shocks suggest that the initial market reaction is incomplete and that long-run performance may be informative. The long-horizon return evidence is most consistent with the mispricing hypothesis and, to some degree, the free cash flow hypothesis. We find little support for the leverage hypothesis.},

Perceived stability of future earnings still affects dividend policy as in Lintner (1956. American Economic Review 46, 97-113). However, 50 years later, we find that the link between dividends and earnings has weakened. Many managers now favor repurchases because they are viewed as being more flexible than dividends and can be used in an attempt to time the equity market or to increase earnings per share. Executives believe that institutions are indifferent between dividends and repurchases and that payout policies have little impact on their investor clientele. In general, management views provide little support for agency, signaling, and clientele hypotheses of payout policy. Tax considerations play a secondary role. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@book{Black1972,
abstract = {Considerable attention has recently been given to general equilibrium models of the pricing of capital assets. Of these, perhaps the best known is the mean-variance formulation originally developed by Sharpe (1964) and Treynor (1961), and extended and clarified by Lintner (1965a; 1965b), Mossin (1966), Fama (1968a; 1968b), and Long (1972). In addition Treynor (1965), Sharpe (1966), and Jensen (1968; 1969) have developed portfolio evaluation models which are either based on this asset pricing model or bear a close relation to it. In the development of the asset pricing model it is assumed that (1) all investors are single period risk-averse utility of terminal wealth maximizers and can choose among portfolios solely on the basis of mean and variance, (2) there are no taxes or transactions costs, (3) all investors have homogeneous views regarding the parameters of the joint probability distribution of all security returns, and (4) all investors can borrow and lend at a given riskless rate of interest. The main result of the model is a statement of the relation between the expected risk premiums on individual assets and their "systematic risk." Our main purpose is to present some additional tests of this asset pricing model which avoid some of the problems of earlier studies and which, we believe, provide additional insights into the nature of the structure of security returns. The evidence presented in Section II indicates the expected excess return on an asset is not strictly proportional to its B, and we believe that this evidence, coupled with that given in Section IV, is sufficiently strong to warrant rejection of the traditional form of the model given by (1). We then show in Section III how the cross-sectional tests are subject to measurement error bias, provide a solution to this problem through grouping procedures, and show how cross-sectional methods are relevant to testing the expanded two-factor form of the model. We show in Section IV that the mean of the beta factor has had a positive trend over the period 1931-65 and was on the order of 1.0 to 1.3{\%} per month in the two sample intervals we examined in the period 1948-65. This seems to have been significantly different from the average risk-free rate and indeed is roughly the same size as the average market return of 1.3 and 1.2{\%} per month over the two sample intervals in this period. This evidence seems to be sufficiently strong enough to warrant rejection of the traditional form of the model given by (1). In addition, the standard deviation of the beta factor over these two sample intervals was 2.0 and 2.2{\%} per month, as compared with the standard deviation of the market factor of 3.6 and 3.8{\%} per month. Thus the beta factor seems to be an important determinant of security returns.},

In particular, firms with strong growth opportunities and riskier cash flows hold relatively high ratios of cash to total non-cash assets. Firms that have the greatest access to the capital markets, such as large firms and those with high credit ratings, tend to hold lower ratios of cash to total non-cash assets. At the same time, however, we find evidence that firms that do well tend to accumulate more cash than predicted by the static tradeoff model where managers maximize shareholder wealth. There is little evidence that excess cash has a large short-run impact on capital expenditures, acquisition spending, and payouts to shareholders. The main reason that firms experience large changes in excess cash is the occurrence of operating losses. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Investors may disagree with the manager about the firm's investment projects. A repurchase causes a change in the investor base as investors who are more likely to disagree with the manager tender their shares. This model leads to the following predictions. First, a firm is more likely to buy back shares when the level of investor-management agreement is lower. Second, the level of agreement improves following a repurchase. Third, once the stock price and investor-management agreement are controlled for, dispersion of opinion among investors cannot explain repurchase activity. Our empirical tests provide strong support for these predictions. The results are robust to controls for information asymmetry and other factors that may drive a firm's share repurchase decision. Overall, the evidence is consistent with firms strategically using repurchases to improve alignment between management and shareholders.},

Consistent with price support, the association is positive and statistically significant each year from 2003 to 2014. We find that the price support quarter is followed by a sharp multi-quarter decline in ROA (return on assets), but the corresponding decline in EPS (earnings per share) is modest due to the reduction in outstanding shares. Abnormal returns after the price support quarter are positive, indicating that price support is effective. We also examine trading by insiders. While insiders generally sell when shorts sell, they hold onto shares during the price support quarter. This indicates that insiders are confident that they can maintain the current stock price.},

Indeed, we find that repurchasing firms tend to face higher takeover probability in the first few years following their OMR announcements, and that the increase in takeover risk can largely explain their post-announcement long-run abnormal returns documented in the literature. The increase in takeover risk is larger for smaller firms, firms with poorer pre-announcement stock performance, and those attracting more attention of market participants.

METHODOLOGY: Three new entropy estimators are introduced; two new LZ-based estimators, and the "renewal entropy estimator," which is tailored to data generated by a binary renewal process. For two of the four LZ-based estimators, a bootstrap procedure is described for evaluating their standard error, and a practical rule of thumb is heuristically derived for selecting the values of their parameters in practice. THEORY: We prove that, unlike their earlier versions, the two new LZ-based estimators are universally consistent, that is, they converge to the entropy rate for every finite-valued, stationary and ergodic process. An effective method is derived for the accurate approximation of the entropy rate of a finite-state hidden Markov model (HMM) with known distribution. Heuristic calculations are presented and approximate formulas are derived for evaluating the bias and the standard error of each estimator. SIMULATION: All estimators are applied to a wide range of data generated by numerous different processes with varying degrees of dependence and memory. The main conclusions drawn from these experiments include: (i) For all estimators considered, the main source of error is the bias. (ii) The CTW method is repeatedly and consistently seen to provide the most accurate results, (in) The performance of the LZ-based estimators is often comparable to that of the plug-in method. (iv) The main drawback of the plug-in method is its computational inefficiency; with small word-lengths it fails to detect longer-range structure in the data, and with longer word-lengths the empirical distribution is severely undersampled, leading to large biases.},

@article{Jagannathan2003,
abstract = {This paper examines the differences in motives, firm characteristics, market performance and subsequent operating performance of firms that repurchase shares frequently versus firms that repurchase only occasionally or infrequently. With the growing popularity of open market repurchase programs it has become relatively common for firms to repurchase shares on a regular or frequent basis. Frequent repurchases appear to be motivated by a different rationale from more infrequent repurchases. Frequent repurchasers are much larger, have significantly less variation in operating income and higher dividend payout ratios. Infrequent repurchases are made by smaller firms with potentially high degrees of asymmetric information. The firms that repurchase infrequently have more volatile operating income, significantly lower institutional ownership and significantly higher managerial ownership. Further, infrequent repurchasers have lower market-to-book ratios suggesting that they are more likely to be undervalued. The market reactions to the repurchase announcements are consistent with these ideas. Although on average all repurchases appear to be viewed favorably by the market, infrequent repurchases are greeted with a much stronger positive reaction. Infrequent repurchases are preceded by negative abnormal returns suggesting that undervaluation, or a depressed stock price, may indeed motivate these repurchases, while frequent repurchases are preceded by relatively normal rates of return. Not only do we find no evidence of improved operating performance following frequent repurchase announcements, but we also find no evidence of improved operating performance for the less frequent repurchases.},

Yet due to their inherent flexibility, open-market repurchase programs have long been criticized as weak signals lacking commitment. We evaluate whether some managers potentially use buyback announcements to mislead investors. We focus on cases where managers were seemingly under heavy pressure to boost stock prices and might have announced a repurchase only to convey a false signal. For suspect cases, the immediate market reaction to a buyback announcement does not differ from that generally observed. However over longer horizons, suspect firms do not enjoy the improvement in economic performance otherwise observed. Suspect firms repurchase less stock. Further, managers in suspect firms have comparatively higher exposure to stock options, a potentially endogenous result suggesting greater sensitivity to both stock valuation and to future equity dilution. Overall, the results suggest only a limited number of managers may have used buybacks in a misleading way as "cheap talk." Yet as theory also suggests, we find no long-run economic benefit to this behavior. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

abstract = {We re-examine the behavior of stock returns after share buyback and equity issuance announcements using the five-factor model proposed by Fama and French (2015a). We confirm the findings of Fama and French (2015b) that the equity issue anomaly, i.e., the fact that equity issues are followed by negative long-term excess returns, disappears after replacing the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model with the five-factor model. However, long term positive excess returns after buyback announcements, first reported by Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995), remain economically and statistically significant. Moreover, the Undervaluation Index proposed by Peyer and Vermaelen (2009) remains a useful proxy for the likelihood that the buyback is driven by undervaluation. The buyback anomaly is robust over time and across sectors. Firms with low correlations with the market seem to be better at market timing, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the repurchase is driven by superior company-specific information. Firms with high pre-announce stock returns volatility also have higher abnormal returns, which is consistent with the hypothesis that a repurchase authorization is an option to take advantage of undervaluation as argued by Ikenberry and Vermaelen (1996). This result is also consistent with Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) who find a positive relation between stock returns and idiosyncratic volatility for undervalued stocks, and unlike the well-known low volatility anomaly. Finally, based on these findings, we develop an enhanced Undervaluation Index that improves abnormal returns relative to the index developed by Peyer and Vermaelen (2009).},

This result suggests that returns to risk arbitrage are similar to those obtained from selling uncovered index put options.  Although linear asset pricing models provide reasonable estimates of the excess returns in risk arbitrage, a contingent claims analysis that incorporates the non-linearity in returns provides a more accurate description of the risk/return relationship.

abstract = {This paper provides evidence that a firm's repurchase frequency helps identify repurchase motives more precisely. Frequent repurchasers buy back stock almost every year and are reluctant to reduce repurchases, even when earnings decline. Investors expect frequent repurchasers to continue repurchasing and react less strongly to their repurchase announcements as well as actual repurchases. In contrast, infrequent repurchasers follow a flexible buyback policy and adjust repurchases with changes in earnings in a more timely manner. They repurchase to signal undervaluation and convey new information about future returns. The growth in the proportion of firms that repurchase frequently explains the recent weakening of undervaluation and flexibility as repurchase motives.},

@article{Stephens1998,
abstract = {Unlike Dutch auction repurchases and tender offers, open-market repurchase programs do not precommit firms to acquire a specified number of shares. In a sample of 450 programs from 1981 to 1990, firms on average acquire 74 to 82 percent of the shares announced as repurchase targets within three years of the repurchase announcement. We find that share repurchases are negatively related to prior stock price performance, suggesting that firms increase their purchasing depending on its degree of perceived undervaluation. In addition, repurchases are positively related to levels of cash flow, which is consistent with liquidity arguments.},

abstract = {We investigate whether firms use stock repurchases to meet or beat analysts' earnings per share (EPS) forecasts. We identify conditions under which repurchases increase EPS and document the frequency of accretive repurchases from 1988 to 2001. We find a disproportionately large number of accretive stock repurchases among firms that would have missed analysts' forecasts without the repurchase. The repurchase-induced component of earnings surprises appears to be discounted by the market, and this discount is larger when the repurchase seems motivated by EPS management, although using the repurchase to avoid missing analyst forecasts appears to mitigate some of the negative stock price response. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Compressibility of individual sequences by the class of generalized finite-state information-Iossless encoders is investigated. These encoders can operate in a variable-rate mode as well as a fixed-rate one, and they allow for any finite-state scheme of variable-length-to-variable-Iength coding. For every individual infinite sequence x a quantity p (x) is defined, called the compressibility of x, which is shown to be the asymptotically attainable lower bound on the oompression ratio that can be achleved for x by any finite-state encoder. This is demonstrated by means of a constructive coding theorem and its converse that, apart from their asymptotic significance, also provide useful performance criteria for finite and practical data-compression tasks. The proposed concept of compressibility is also shown to play a role analogous to that of entropy in classical information theory where one deals with probabilistic ensembles of sequences rather than with individual sequences. Wbiie the definition of $\rho$ (x) allows a different machine for each different sequence to be compressed, the coustructive coding theorem leads to a universal algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for all sequences. {\textcopyright} 1978 IEEE},

abstract = {We examine how product market threats influence firm payout policy and cash holdings. We develop new measures of competitive threats using firms' product text descriptions. Our primary measure, product market fluidity, captures changes in rival firms' products relative to the firm's products. We show that fluidity decreases firm propensity to make payouts via dividends or repurchases and also increases the cash held by firms, especially for firms with less access to financial markets. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that firms' financial policies are significantly shaped by product market threats and dynamics.},

@incollection{Schwert2003a,
abstract = {Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior. They indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model. After they are documented and analyzed in the academic literature, anomalies often seem to disappear, reverse, or attenuate. This raises the question of whether profit opportunities existed in the past, but have since been arbitraged away, or whether the anomalies were simply statistical aberrations that attracted the attention of academics and practitioners. One of the interesting findings from the empirical work in this chapter is that many of the well-known anomalies in the finance literature do not hold up in different sample periods. In particular, the size effect and the value effect seem to have disappeared after the papers that highlighted them were published. At about the same time, practitioners began investment vehicles that implemented the strategies implied by the academic papers. The weekend effect and the dividend yield effect also seem to have lost their predictive power after the papers that made them famous were published. In these cases, however, I am not aware of any practitioners who have tried to use these anomalies as a major basis of their investment strategy. The small-firm turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was first documented in the academic literature, although there is some evidence that it still exists. Interestingly, however, it does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners who focus on small-capitalization firms. Likewise, the evidence that stock market returns are predictable using variables such as dividend yields or inflation is much weaker in the periods after the papers that documented these findings were published. All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real. The notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the market to become more efficient). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Using a data set of all U.S. repurchases from 2004 to 2011, we compare the actual average price paid monthly in a repurchase with the average market price for the same stock over various horizons. We find that firms repurchase stock at a significantly lower price than the average market price in all sample years. Less frequent repurchasers, firms that repurchase when insiders buy on their own account, and firms that experience low stock returns prior to the repurchase obtain significantly lower prices. After controlling for risk factors, repurchasing firms earn positive returns. Infrequent repurchasers earn a significantly higher return up to three years following the actual repurchase.},

Three principal groups of payers have emerged: firms that pay dividends and make regular repurchases, firms that make regular repurchases, and firms that make occasional repurchases. Firms that only pay dividends are largely extinct. Repurchases are increasingly used in place of dividends, even for firms that continue to pay dividends. While other factors help explain the timing of repurchases, the overall level of repurchases is fundamentally determined by earnings. The results suggest that repurchases are now the dominant form of payout. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
